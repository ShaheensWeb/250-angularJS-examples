Inspired by [Curran Kelleher](https://github.com/curran/portfolio) repository with over 1500+ stars featuring 50 well made Angular.JS examples and lecture videos I thought I would develop my own repository consisting of what I would consider the basics of angular. 

## Goals of this repo:
  * Write atleast 250 basic angular.JS apps covering the fundementals, basics, and even some intermediate code snippets.
  * Cover basic keywords associated with Angular.JS (scope, controllers, imports, etc)
  * Cover the concept of MVC(model view controller) vs MVW(model view what ever)
  * More.. feel free to add
  * 

This repo commenced Oct 2015, all creation done by [Shaheen Ghazazani](http://shaheensweb.me) 

## Examples
 * [Example 1](https://github.com/ShaheensWeb/250-angularJS-examples/blob/master/example1/index-example1.html)
