Inspired by Curran's repo holding two lecture videos with correlated youtube links I thought I would develop my own repository consisting of what I would consider the basics of angular JS. This repo will hold basic term definitions, constants associated with angular.JS and data-binding in general, and 250 (soon to be created) angular.JS examples.
